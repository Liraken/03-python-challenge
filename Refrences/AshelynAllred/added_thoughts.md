# Thoughts and Notes
## "Average Change" confusion
It was not clearly specified in the assignment what "Average Change" was supposed to be. It took some figuring out that it was supposed to be the *overall* rate of change across the whole range. I ended up on the "Rate of Change" formula

### $`\frac{f(t_{final}) - f(t_{init})}{t_{final} - t_{init}}`$

which ended up returning the correct output value. ($f(t)$ being P/L, and $t$ being months) I'd grade the instructions on the first portion about 89% as a result of this confusion.

## Omission of policy for Pandas ban on this project
I decided not to use the `pandas` library for this assignment out of a desire to learn how to do things "the hard way"; however, **there was no mention at all in the assignment instructions whether `pandas` was allowed, despite apparent word from senior staff that it would result in a 'no grade' from central grading** (as reported from a fellow student who had questions on the assignment; they were apparently informed of this via direct support chats).

I find such a policy unacceptable due to the lack of specificity on allowed libraries in the instructions. As a result, I have to take off a lot of points for the final grade of these instructions. Tell us what you want, and tell us what is and isn't allowed. Thank you.
