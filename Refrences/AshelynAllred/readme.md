# Python CSV Practice
Code in here was written as an assignment for a data analytics course.
Aside from researching unfamiliar syntax, all Python code here is my own work.

Script files are in the `PyBank` and `PyPoll` folders under `main.py`.
Analysis output is written as `analysis.txt` inside of the `analysis` subfolders

**Note that the working directory for the scripts is _inside_ of the `PyBank` and `PyPoll` folders for each script, respectively.**
